➡ 4. Insights Drawn:

From Attrtion by education chart, we can notice that most of the employees who left the company are from a life science background and Medical background.

➡ From the Attrition by role chart, the matrix table shows the job satisfaction level of the employees from all departments and also we can notice that Laboratory Technicians are having less job satisfaction.

➡ From the Attrition by level combination chart depicts that the employees who are falling in the age range 30-35 and not getting promotions, still continuing at level 2 are leaving the company.

➡ From the attrition by Hike slab chart, the employees who are in the hike slab of 5k are leaving the company.

➡ From the attrition by Tenure, the employees whose tenure is in the range of 0 - 2 years within the organization are mostly leaving the company
